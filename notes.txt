MongoDB:

  - its a non relational ,no-sql, document based open source database management system.
  -faster
  -scalable
  -document based-Json documents-data will be stored as key-value pairs
  -schemaless(it is not based on particular structures that means like table structure in mysql).



  Mysql                      MongoDB
  ----------------------------------
  database                   database
  table                      collection
  row/tuple/entity           document
  column                     fields
  primarykey                 _id (12bit hexadecimal value for every document which is unique)



---------------------------
->Mongoose -ODM library:
 -object data modelling library for mongodb and node.Json
 -used to translate objects in node app and representation of those objects in monogodb
 -defines schema/structure for storing documents in a collection of MongoDB
      schema Types(string,number,default,...)
      options(required,default)
 -creates model similar to collection where we can store documents
 -install mongoose:npm i mongoose
 -create connection:
             - create folder in server:DB Folder
             -create a js file to define connection


  JWT(JSON Web Token):
  -mechanism used for aunthentication
  -need jsonwebtoken package
  -generates a token value if the given credentials for authentication is valid,and pass it to user side
  -every requests from user side after aunthentication will need token value with it,bcs only after verifying that token,
  -will follow to request resolving
  -uses sign() method for token generation
  -uses verify() method for token verification

  =>middleware

  -special functions that can process requests in between client and server,and,block the request  if they needed to

  const middleware=(req,res,next)=>{
    req
    next()
  }
